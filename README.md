# Time-Parallel Methods for Stratigraphic Forward Models

This repository contains code and documentation for implementing and testing time-parallel methods (ParaDiag II) on a stratigraphic forward model in both the 1-Dimensional and 2-Dimensional case.

# Dependencies

These algorithms use Firedrake which is PDE solver based on finite element methods. The installation instructions  can be found [here](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/index.html). The time parallel methods uses the asQ package. The repository can be found [here](https://github.com/firedrakeproject/asQ/tree/master)
